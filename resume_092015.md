* Hands-on experience of designing, implementing, and modelling of optical and millimeter-wave communication systems.

* Developed holographic filters for Laser mode conversion for spatial--division multiplexed optical communications. Mitigation of optical Fiber nonlinearity for > 40-Gb/s RZ, CSRZ, and DPSK modulation formats in long-haul WDM transmission systems. Mathematical modeling of higher-order Laser beam propagation in free-space and through bulk optics. Demonstrated 28-GHz millimeter--wave communications.

 * Generation/detection of Coherent/Noncoherent 40 Gb/s OOK and 50 Gbaud QPSK, 16-QAM signals. System performance assessment using Synthesizers, Pattern Generators, RFSA, OSA, VNA, BERT, Optical Modulation Analyzer, Real-time and Sampling Scopes, AWG. Characterization and operation of RF amplifiers, Drivers, I/Q Mixers, Filters, Antennae, Frequency doublers, Attenuators, Power splitters

 * Simulation tools such as VPI Transmission Maker, Optiwave's OptiSystem, and Synopsys's Code V. Modelling of data transmission in optical fibers and free-space

 * Programming languages &amp; development tools such as C/C++, Matlab, Python, LabVIEW, Mathematica, MS Visual Studio, Xcode, and Unit testing using Google Test

 * Strong project managements skills, prepared successful proposals and white papers for government agencies and industrial corporations. Actively participated in kick-off and review meetings. Collaborated &amp co-authored with research groups at Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Intel Research Labs, University of Glasgow, Tel Aviv University, University of Rochester, University of Arizona.
