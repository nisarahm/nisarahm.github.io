I have Hands-on experience of designing, implementing, and modelling of optical and millimeter-wave communication systems. 

<!-- Complete details can be seen in my [<span class="blue"><b>Curriculum Vitae</b></span>]({{site.url}}/AhmedNisar_CV_Oct2015.pdf). -->

Specific skills include :

 * Generation/detection of Coherent/Noncoherent 40 Gb/s OOK and 50 Gbaud QPSK, 16-QAM signals

 * System performance assessment using Synthesizers, Pattern Generators, RFSA, OSA, VNA, BERT, Optical Modulation Analyzer, Real--time and Sampling Scopes, AWG

 * Generation and (de)modulation of 16--QAM signals at 28 GHz, 16--QAM OFDM signals at 5 GHz. 

 * Characterization and operation of RF amplifiers, Drivers, I/Q Mixers, Filters, Antennae, Frequency doublers, Attenuators, Power splitters
 
 * Simulation tools such as VPI Transmission Maker, Optiwave's OptiSystem, and Synopsys's Code V. Modelling of data transmission in optical fibers and free-space

 * Programming languages &amp; development tools such as C/C++, Matlab, Python, LabVIEW, Mathematica, MS Visual Studio, Xcode, and Unit testing using Google Test
